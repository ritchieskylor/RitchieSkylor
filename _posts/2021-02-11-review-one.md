## **Summary**

_Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago_ is a digital humanities project displaying one of the world’s most famous and greatest collections of Impressionist art. This website presents the works of Claude Monet, a French painter from the nineteenth century. With a collection of nearly 50 analyzed paintings and descriptions of its contributors, the website allows for an informative, interactive experience. 

## **Design**

Created under project director Gloria Groom, the site uses tools such as ChicagoCodeX (CCX), OSCI Toolkit, X-ray composites, and IMA Lab to combine academic studies with advanced imaging technology to translate both art and history. Groom exhibits a firm foundation as she is an internationally praised scholar and author on 19th Century French painting. As the Chair of European Painting and Sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, she proved to be a great candidate to enrich the digital realm in this field.

## **Findings**

_Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago_ does a proficient job of merging technology and Claude Monet’s famous pieces. As stated in the Project Overview, the format is intended to satisfy a wide range of users, both scholars and ordinary museum visitors. The website layout resembles that of an interactive book. Each page displays a piece of art which is then discussed in depth. To the reader’s benefit, the descriptions contain various headings and subheadings to easily navigate the passage. Below the images, there is access to a pop-up bar of footnotes, figures, and a glossary for any unfamiliar words. This supports the statement of enforcing a wide range of usability. The _Table of Contents_ tab allows for navigation throughout the interactive book. While it is helpful, following the selection of a section in the book, the tab does not go away and often covers art or text. The user has to exit the tab to make it disappear which is often a hassle.

The imaging technology used to capture the pieces of art is worth noting. Each image allows the user to enter a full screen mode and zoom in to interact with the individual sections of the painting. This allows each unique brush stroke and pencil mark to be amplified for close examination. There is also a feature which allows the user to see which part of the piece they are zoomed in on while being zoomed in. To exit the enlarged view, there is a refresh button to return to the original view of the image. This viewing technology is extremely useful and effective for close analysis.

As stated when opening the website on a mobile device, the project is not intended for devices smaller than 1024 pixels (i.e., iPad size). This message does not go away when navigating the page, thus eliminating readability of the top of the screen. While some features still function, the layout of the site becomes difficult to read and the images appear hardly visible. The creators may find it beneficial to design a more user friendly interface for mobile devices as they become increasingly abundant and relied on in society, even if it is not able to encompass all that an enlarged view can.

Finally, and most helpful, the website includes a link to a video showing viewers how to best interact with the site. While this is very helpful, it is located at the very end of the book in a small font. To promote use, it would be best if the link was displayed near the beginning of the book and highlighted in some way.

Overall, _Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago_ is effective and well done. While there are always improvements that could be made to provide a more user-friendly, efficient interface, the site displays and informs Claude Monet’s art beautifully.
