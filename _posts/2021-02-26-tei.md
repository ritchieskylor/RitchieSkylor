# TEI (Coding) Blog Post

In this assignment, I was given a section of “The Yellow Wall-paper” by Charlotte Perkins to code using Text Coding Initiative (TEI) through Oxygen XML (eXtensible Markup Language) Editor. “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a short story written in the 19th century which illustrates how the mental and physical health of women was regarded during that time. Through using Google Docs and Oxygen, I was able to examine, mark up, and code several pages of the text.

To begin the coding process, we were each designated a Google Doc with transcriptions from four pages of the original text. We started with annotating each page by adding comments to explain certain features of the text. These features included things like page beginnings, paragraphs, em-dashes (which were previously foreign to me), and quotes. My section mainly included a plethora of em-dashes and paragraphs. Perkins writes using very small paragraphs, some only a sentence long, so I frequented the paragraph tag. Initially, I failed to understand the importance of marking up the Google Doc, but it became helpful in Oxygen, serving as my own little cheat sheet.

When I first downloaded Oxygen, I panicked as the tiny characters and gibberish code caused my mind to blank on the initial steps I was supposed to take. Thankfully, my professor was my saving grace, as she recorded our lecture full of helpful tidbits and instructions to refer back to. After reviewing the guided tutorial and finding specific places that required my insertion, I was able to easily navigate Oxygen and enter my own pieces of text with integrated tags.

I suppose things were going all too smoothly, as I hadn’t experienced any true mishaps. When I finally attempted to save all that I had accomplished, Oxygen lit up with an error box. My heart was about to sink, so I quickly signed up for office hours. Thankfully, my professor knew just how to solve the issue, and it was a quick fix. I simply needed to save the file to a different place on my computer.

While I had no prior experience with coding or TEI, I am typically able to pick up technological skills fairly easily. This was advantageous and made the assignment a breeze for me. Looking back at my completed work in Oxygen, I feel accomplished and proud of my coding-even if it is just the tip of the iceberg. I look forward to any future coding projects to further my TEI skillset.
